I am a snowed in Mini Cooper! I\u2019ve talked to you previously, then I was only frozen now I am covered in snow and cold! Brrrr! London is battling a winterstorm called #beastoftheeast and that means quite some snow. It\u2019s not easy for us little cars because the ground is cold and we\u2019re so close to the ground. It doesn\u2019t take much to get us covered in snow up to our wheels! Personally, I quite like the snow, you don\u2019t see it that often and it brings its joys! Ever tried racing around town with snow? It turns the roads into a sliding centre, like the one they go down with a sleigh \ud83d\udef7 at the Winter Olympics!

All seats turn 180 degrees and there is a little foldable desk, ideal for when your stuck in traffic and you still need to hold a meeting or finish that important report!

That allows you to drive wherever you want after you have finished the work you needed to do and the traffic jam has resolved. Anyway, I am currently being assembled here at CECOMP in Torino. Yesterday I had loads of car design students come and have a look at me because they wanted to understand more about the car design process!

HP usually stands for horsepower but I\'m pretty sure I don\'t have 800 horsepower, maybe it stands for HP sauce. According to my @officiallittletikes brochure, I was born for 18 months - 5 year olds, built for childhood memories and I\'m super fun! Unfortunately kids get older automatically and that is apparently when I get discarded. I\'ve just been put out by the trash! I know I\'m not in the best state, my steering wheel fell off and my wing mirror is a little bit dirty. But what about the memories we had together? What about the road trips to the playground? What about that time we were stranded out in the rain? Anyway, before I end up on a landfill I\'m going to see if I can find a different young driver that would love to drive me around their local playground or garden!","hashtags":["#instalike","#trash","#cargram","#toycar","#carsofinstagram","#drivetastefully","#toys","#littletikes","#carswithoutlimits","#instacar","#igers","#getoutanddrive","#green","#stopwaitingforfriday","#carporn","#reuse","#carlifestyle","#story","#littlemovingthings","#4x4","#igerslondon","#memories","#carstagram","#recycling"]},{"id":"1557051776","time":"1557051776","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxE80LJlgGs/","location":"London Borough of Hackney","text":"Hello!
